# App.js

App.js is the root component of your ocular website. It contains the routes system.
It also includes the [Header](/website/src/docs/reference/build-your-own-components/2-app/2-Header.md) and the [Toc](./toc) components.

Finally, it also offers google analytics tracking, if you specified a GA_TRACKING key in your configuration file.
