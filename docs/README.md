# ocular

Ocular is a tool primarily designed for building documentation websites for github-based javascript frameworks, built using the gatsbyjs documentation generation system.

Note that there are two versions of ocular described in this documentation. We are moving to the newer gatsby-based version of ocular. The "classic" variant is still documented for backwards compatibility, but will be removed as all frameworks migrate. The classic version is not maintained and new sites should be built using the gatsbyjs-based generator, you have been warned. .
