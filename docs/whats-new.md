## 1.0.0-alpha.6
- Fix webpack config support and logging
- ocular-gatsby is now published without beta tag to ensure latest version gets installed.

## 1.0.0-alpha.5
- CLI added (`ocular init` creates working page).

## 1.0.0-alpha.4
- Bump to `gatsby` 2.0.85.
- Add `logLevel` support for debugging ocular. Hide verbose logging under `logLevel`.
- Support debugging of webpack config and aliases.
- Improved docs

## 1.0.0-alpha.3
- Allow `gatsby` peer dependency version to be controlled by app website (i.e ocular no longer pins it).
