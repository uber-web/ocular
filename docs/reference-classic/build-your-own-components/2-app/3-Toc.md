# Toc.js

Toc.js is the Table of contents component. While it technically exists on every page of an ocular site, in its default configuration, it only shows for components that exist within a documentation tree. 

In that case, Toc will display a table of content for that tree. The active documentation page will be highlighted, the documentation section it is part of will be open, and all the other ones will appear collapsed.
