# Home.js

The Home component corresponds to the landing page of your ocular web app. It includes the [Hero](./hero) and [Footer](./footer) components. 

The Header component, which is typically visible on the landing page, technically belongs to the App component.

By default, Home features the Hero component at the top of the page. 

Then there are bullet points describing the project on the left side, and a block of text on the right side. 
These come from the HOME_BULLETS and HOME_RIGHT parameters in the configuration file.  

The next section presents a list of contributors taken from the GitHub page of the project if applicable. 

Finally, there's the Footer component at the bottom of the page.
