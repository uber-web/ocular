# ocular

Ocular is a tool primarily designed for building documentation websites for github-based javascript frameworks, built using the gatsbyjs documentation generation system.

This is the newer gatsby-based version of ocular (v1.0.0 and later). Note that in addition to this gatsbyjs-based generator, Ocular also support a "classic" variant (v0.x) for backwards compatibility. The classic version is not maintained and new sites should be built using the gatsbyjs-based generator. See documentation on [github]().
