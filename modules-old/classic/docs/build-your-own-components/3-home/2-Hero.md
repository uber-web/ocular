# Hero.js

The Hero component appears at the top of your ocular's landing page.

By default, it features the name of the project, its description and a "get started" button that points to the first page of documentation.
The name of the project comes from the PROJECT_NAME parameter in the configuration file, and the description comes from PROJECT_DESC. Both values are filled during the initilization process, but can be overwritten afterwards.
