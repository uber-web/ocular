# Default links

In addition to [Documentation Routes](./2-documentation-routes.md) and [Custom Pages](./3-custom-pages.md), the Header also features 2 links by default. 

## Home page

One of these links associates the '/' route to the [Home](../build-your-own-components/3-home/1-Home.md) component. 

## Search page

The other matches the '/search' route to the Search component.
