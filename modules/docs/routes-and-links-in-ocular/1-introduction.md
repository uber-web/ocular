# Introduction to routes

Routes are a way to make a certain url suffix to point to either a page of documentation or to a custom made part of the app.

Ocular let users configure how to determine that correspondance through two files: __/src/mdRoutes.js__, for the documentation pages, and __/src/jsRoutes.js__, for custom pages. 

In addition, you can also provide links for the header:
- project links, which would populate the drop-down menu in the top-left,
- additional links, which will appear in the top-right part of the screen.
