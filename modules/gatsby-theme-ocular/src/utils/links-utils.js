  // link to another markdown file that we will honor.

  // let's suppose that we want to go from a file:
  // - physical location: /docs/my-files/source.md, slug: /docs/chapter-1/source
  // to this file:
  // - phyiscal location: /docs/developer-guide/target.md, slug: /docs/advanced-usage/api-reference/target

  // by default, '../../advanced-usage/api/reference/target' would work (target file slug, relative to original slug)
  // '/docs/advanced-usage/api-reference/target' would also work (absolute target slug)
  // however, on github, those links wouldn't work as there is no phyiscal file behind that link.
  // in github however: '/docs/developer-guide/target.md' (file name relative to root) or
  // '../developer-guide/target.md' (relative file name) would work. Those links wouldn't work on the gatsby rendered
  // page however (until that).

  // we are creating a mapping so that ANY OF THESE 4 SYNTAXES would be honored.
  // So, authors can use links that refer to physical files, and gatsby will render a link that works - the same link
  // can work on github and gatsby

  // note that often, the physical location and the slug are the same!
  // However there is no guarantee that this will be the case.
